# #SADDERmetrics CoŒµmeta Web App 

This is a super early prototype experimenting with the idea of [advanced analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_statistics_in_basketball) for social media. 

Kinda like [Sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) for twitter. So obviously it's called **#SADDERmetrics**.

Maybe it stands for **_Social Analytics Depicting Deeper Empirical Reality_** or something. 

But probably not.

Some background & motivation can be found in this [video walkthru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hn5EhbTqyk), this [blog post](https://dnlmc.medium.com/ingroup-colossus-visakanv-744c08f408f2?sk=79d5a0c6880c38dc6c5e82d05c3a8383) & [these](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1482388817868988416) [twitter](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1480220400491634689) [threads](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1471526268860608520).
