# #SADDERmetrics CoŒµmeta Web App 

This is a super early prototype experimenting with the idea of [advanced analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_statistics_in_basketball) for social media. 

Kinda like [Sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) for twitter. So obviously it's called **#SADDERmetrics**.

Maybe it stands for **_Social Analytics Depicting Deeper Empirical Reality_** or something. 

But probably not.
